First it supports animating an array of elements, extracting the keys for each element, and  then applying the correct animation to each element, which is quite an impressive feat if you consider how we started declaring animated values one at a time. This hook returns an array with all the elements we need to render our animation, we have to return the transition array and map over it each iteration receives 3 important named variables, item, which represents the current item we're mapping it is either the first argument we passed or an index of it. The second named element is \\\"key\\\" and this is the product of the second argument passed to the transition hook, in this case, it's not relevant, we're only passing it in order to not piss off the warning system. the third named element is called \\\"props\\\" and I think this is a bit misleading, these are the animation props, so you would ideally pass this object directly into your animated component's inline styles. I like to de-structure its content's as I feel it gives me more flexibility. from there on you just return the element you wanted to animate with the given values and let the magic happen.\"), mdx(\"hr\", null), mdx(Emoji, {\n    mdxType: \"Emoji\"\n  }), mdx(Notes, {\n    mdxType: \"Notes\"\n  }, \"This is the code we were just looking at.
